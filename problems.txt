Problem 1: 
  The navbar doesn't stick after it passes the hero banner.The problem is that somewhere, it's either overflowing when it's not suppoed to, or the stacking order is interrupted.

  Steps taken to fix:
    - Used dev tools to check each parent to see if overflow was   
      appied: negative.
    
    - Checked whether my <nav> was scrolling when it's not supposed 
      to: negative.
    
    - Checked if any ancestor element had transform, filter, 
      perspective, or opacity applied: Yes.
        - Added, "transform-style: preserve-3d" and "will-change: 
          transform" to .grid-container img:hover {}
        
        - Added, "transform: none" to .grid-container.
    
    - Since these didn't work, i used position: fixed on the header tag to see if it would work and it did.
      - Adjusted some html and css to refine it.

Problem 2:
  - with the adjusted css to fix the previous bug, one of the images 
    was larger than the rest and was nesting three images. this was because i didn't set a specific height or aspect ratio and the overflow-hidden was interfering with it. 

  - Fix:
      - Set the height to 300 px in .img-wrapper{}.
      - Changed the height: auto to height: 100% in .img-wrapper img.
      - Cleared the cache since it was still not working.
  
  - Since the last attempt fixed the issue, i changed the height in img-wrapper to auto and used aspect-ratio: 1 / 1 in img-wrapper{}.

Problem 3:
  - text-align: justify was being inherited by section p{} due to higher priority.
  - Fix:
      - explicitly place text-align: center in .pre-order p{}.
