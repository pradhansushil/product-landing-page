Problem 1:
  The navbar doesn’t stick after it passes the hero banner.  
  The issue seems to be caused by either unintended overflow or an interrupted stacking context.

  Steps taken to fix:
    - Used dev tools to check each parent element for overflow: none found.
    - Verified whether the <nav> was scrolling unexpectedly: no.
    - Checked if any ancestor element had CSS properties like transform, filter, perspective, or opacity applied: Yes.
      - Added "transform-style: preserve-3d" and "will-change: transform" to `.grid-container img:hover`.
      - Added "transform: none" to `.grid-container`.
    - Since these didn’t work, applied `position: fixed` to the header tag, which resolved the issue.
      - Made some HTML and CSS adjustments to refine the layout.

Problem 2:
  After adjusting CSS to fix Problem 1, one image appeared larger than the others and nested three images.  
  This was caused by missing explicit height or aspect ratio settings, combined with interference from `overflow-hidden`.

  Fix:
    - Set height to `300px` in `.img-wrapper`.
    - Changed `.img-wrapper img` height from `auto` to `100%`.
    - Cleared cache to ensure changes took effect.
    - After confirming the fix, changed `.img-wrapper` height to `auto` and added `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` for consistent sizing.

Problem 3:
  `text-align: justify` was being inherited by `section p` due to CSS specificity.

  Fix:
    - Explicitly set `text-align: center` in `.pre-order p` to override inheritance.
